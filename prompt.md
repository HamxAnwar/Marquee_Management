## Prompt
- We have a platform_admin dashboard.
  - The dashboard is for software developer company, not the venue owners or staff.
  - Payments, number of organizations and trends with other obvious fields may be included in this dashboard.
  - Since this is a seperate dashboard, changing it should not effect anyother dashboard.
  - Also no other dashboard should be changed/modified.
- In the platform admin dashboard, when I click the oragnizations or other fields, it shows the following errors on the page.
{
  Main dashboard: {
    Error loading settings
    There was an error loading the platform settings.
  }

  Organizatons: {
    Error loading organizations
    There was an error loading the pending organizations.
  }

  Settings: {
    Error loading settings
    There was an error loading the platform settings.
  }
}

Taking into account the above errors, discussions and instructions, read the related files in the codebase and make a plan for platform_admin dashboard.
